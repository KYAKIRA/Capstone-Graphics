# README #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

* This is a repository showing off the features that I have worked on in a capstone C++ engine using opengl and sdl
* Me and a group of friends worked on this engine, I focused much of my attention working on graphical effects for the engine
* This repository will mostly only focus on showing the work I have done in the engine.
* Feel free to check it out and mess around within the scene

### Commits ###

Because I was importing our entire commits from bitbucket I didn't fully commit the entire engine, If you want to see what the entire engine looks like and all the changes you can visit here
